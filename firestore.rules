/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CheckersVerse.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and profiles,
 * and a shared access model for friendships and game sessions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User account information, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/profile: User profile information, owned by the user.
 * - /friendships/{friendshipId}: Friendship relationships, accessible to the two users involved.
 * - /game_sessions/{gameSessionId}: Game session data, accessible to the two players involved.
 * - /game_sessions/{gameSessionId}/messages/{messageId}: Chat messages within a game session, accessible to the two players involved in the game.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own account and profile data.
 * - Friendships are accessible to the two users involved.
 * - Game sessions and associated messages are accessible to the two players involved.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on ownership and relationship integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /friendships/{friendshipId} document includes a `members` map containing the user IDs of the two users in the friendship.
 * - The /game_sessions/{gameSessionId} document includes a `members` map containing the user IDs of the two players in the game.
